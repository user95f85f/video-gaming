Windows VS Linux

Linux has 9 solid games.

Windows has 9 solid games.

Windows dominates in MMORPG's (think: BDO and Tree of Savior), Battle Royale games
(think: Fortnite and CoD: warzone), and Open-World (think: GTA5 and Skyrim).

Linux dominates in Action Roleplaying Games (think: Diablo 1, Diablo 2, and Dota 2),
and First-person Shooters (think Borderlands 2, CS:GO, and Team Fortress 2).

Therefore if you want MMORPG's you'll want to go with either.

Therefore if you want Action RP'ing games you'll want to go with Linux

Therefore if you want Shooter games you'll want Linux

Therefore if you want Battle Royale games you'll want Windows

Therefore if you want Open World games you'll want Windows
